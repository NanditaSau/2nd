<h1>FAST FOOD</h1>

<p>Fast food refers to food that can be prepared and served quickly. ... However, 
fast food is often made with cheaper ingredients such as high fat meat,
 refined grains, and added sugar and fats, instead of 
 nutrious ingredients such as lean meats,
 whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables.</p>
